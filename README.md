# Mendelian-randomization-Project
This project is divided in 3 folders containing the codes used to perform the main Mendelian randomization analysis. 
- The files in the "***GWAS QC***" folder were first used to correct missing values using the 1000 Genomes European reference panel and other corrections related to the GWASs used for the project specifically. Then there are files used to perform clumping
- The "***MR_analysis***" folder conteins the codes for the main MR analysis, sensitivity analyses, plots and FDR correction.
- In the folder ***Power*** there is the Rmd file to perform the power analysis
